# Gothic WordPress Theme

This is a WordPress theme being used at [hughstimson.org](http://hughstimson.org), created by [hughstimson](https://github.com/hughstimson) back in the day.

It's a bit cumbersome because each project category page has to have it's own manually-coded theme page. And it's getting a bit out of date. But maybe it could be useful to someone who wants a theme that includes up-front blogging and a project portfolio? Feel free to use and adapt if you wish. Attribution required is all.
