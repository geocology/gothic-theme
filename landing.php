                        <p>Civilizations in decline are consistently characterized by a tendency
                            toward standardization and uniformity. Conversely, during the growth
                            stage of civilization, the tendency is toward differentiation and
                            diversity.<br>

                            what denies it. What is seen with one eye has no depth.<br>

                        <p>Very frankly, I am opposed to people being programmed by others. My whole approach in
                            broadcasting has always been 'You are an important person just the way you are. You can make
                            healthy decisions.' Maybe I'm going on too long, but I just feel that anything that allows a
                            person to be more active in the control of his or her life, in a healthy way, is
                            important.<br>
